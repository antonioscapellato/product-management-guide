# Product Management Guide
### A Technical Guide for Technical People Switching to Product

You’ve been deep in the code. Scaling systems, shipping features, solving tough problems with clean logic. But now you’re looking up and asking bigger questions:
What should we build next?
Why does it matter?

That’s where product management comes in.

This guide is for engineers, designers, data people — anyone technical — who’s starting to feel the pull toward product. Not because you’re done with tech, but because you want to be part of what gets built, not just how it gets built.

Product is messy. It’s less about clean solutions and more about customer problems, business tradeoffs, and figuring out what will actually move the needle. You’ll go from debugging code to debugging user behavior. From writing specs to shaping stories. From thinking in systems to thinking in outcomes.

Here’s what you’ll get in this guide:

How to shift your mindset from output to impact

Ways to talk to users and actually hear what they need

How to work with non-technical teams without sounding like a robot

Making tradeoffs between value, complexity, and speed

Writing roadmaps and specs that don’t get ignored

You’ve already got the hardest part: the builder’s brain. Now it’s about learning how to apply it differently — to real users, real problems, and real outcomes.

This is your jumpstart into product, minus the fluff.
Let’s dive in.
