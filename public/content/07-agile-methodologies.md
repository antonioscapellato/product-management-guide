# 07 - Agile Methodologies and Product Development

## 1. Scrum vs. Kanban vs. Scrumban

| Framework | Cadence & Structure | When to Use | Example Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scrum** | Timeboxed sprints (1–4 weeks), fixed scope per sprint, defined roles (PO, Scrum Master, Dev Team) | When you need predictable cadence & planning | Launching a major feature every quarter |
| **Kanban** | Continuous flow, work‐in‐progress (WIP) limits, pull-based planning | When work is variable or support-heavy | Handling customer support tickets & bugs |
| **Scrumban** | Hybrid: timeboxes + WIP limits + pull-based replenishment | When you need sprint rhythm + flow flexibility | Early‐stage product with frequent changes |

> Example:
> 
> 
> A mobile app team uses **Scrum** for feature releases, **Kanban** for bug fixes and urgent patches, and transitions to **Scrumban** as they scale to balance new work with maintenance.
