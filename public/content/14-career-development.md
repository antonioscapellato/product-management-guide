# 14 - Career Development and Personal Branding

## 1. Selecting & Framing 2–3 Case Studies

- **Choose Diverse Projects:**
    - **Breadth:** One B2C, one B2B or internal tool, one growth/optimization project
    - **Depth:** Highlight end-to-end ownership (discovery → launch → iteration)
- **Storytelling Structure:**
    1. **Context & Challenge:** What was the problem or opportunity?
    2. **Your Role & Actions:** Decisions you made, frameworks you used.
    3. **Outcome & Impact:** Quantify results (%, $, time saved, user lift).

> Example Case Study Outline:
> 
> - **Context:** Mobile-first music app struggling with Day 7 retention at 30%.
> - **Role:** PM led discovery workshops, ran JTBD interviews, prioritized with RICE.
> - **Actions:** Launched personalized "Discover Weekly" playlists in 3 sprints.
> - **Impact:** Day 7 retention rose to 45% (+50%), contributing to a 12% lift in subscription conversions.


## 2. Structuring a PM Resume: Impact-Driven Bullet Points

- **Resume Sections:** Contact, Summary (optional), Experience, Projects/Case Studies, Education, Skills
- **Experience Entries:**
    - **Format:** **Action** + **Context** + **Result**
    - **Metrics First:** Wherever possible, start with the number.
    - **Framework Callouts:** Briefly mention methodologies (Agile, OKRs, A/B tests).

> Example Bullet Points:
> 
> - **"Increased** onboarding completion from 60% → 85% in 8 weeks by redesigning signup flow and A/B testing CTA copy."
> - **"Drove** \$350K in incremental ARR by launching enterprise-grade analytics dashboard and negotiating 3 new pilot contracts."
> - **"Reduced** customer support tickets by 30% through a contextual in-app FAQ and chatbot integration."
- **Formatting Tips:**
    - One page (for ≤10 yrs experience)
    - Consistent font & clear hierarchy (bold action verbs)
    - No generic buzzwords—focus on unique contributions


## 3. Personal Branding: LinkedIn, GitHub & Blogs

- **LinkedIn:**
    - Complete headline ("Product Manager | Growth & Analytics | Spotify Alumni")
    - Publish 1–2 posts/month: case study highlights, industry insights, book reviews
    - Request 5–10 recommendations from peers, engineers, stakeholders
- **GitHub (or Portfolio Site):**
    - Showcase side-projects or data analysis notebooks
    - Include README case studies with screenshots and metrics
    - Link to interactive prototypes (Figma embeds) if possible
- **Blogging & Thought Leadership:**
    - Medium or personal blog: 1 post/quarter on PM frameworks, lessons learned
    - Example topics: "How to Run Your First A/B Test," "Using HEART to Measure UX"
    - Promote via Twitter/LinkedIn and relevant communities (Product Coalition, Mind the Product)
