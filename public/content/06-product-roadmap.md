# 06 - Product Roadmapping and Planning

## 1. Themes vs. Dates vs. Deliverables

- **Themes**
    - High-level strategic buckets (e.g., "Mobile Expansion," "Monetization," "User Engagement").
    - Help focus product vision and group related work.
- **Dates**
    - Time horizons for planning (e.g., Q3 2025, H1 2026).
    - Provide realistic expectations—but remain flexible.
- **Deliverables**
    - Specific outputs (features, launches, experiments).
    - Tied to themes and dates but more granular (e.g., "In-app Chat v1," "Payment A/B Test").

> Example:
> 
> - **Theme:** "Global Growth"
>     - **Q3 2025** → Deliverable: "Multi-currency Wallet MVP"
>     - **Q4 2025** → Deliverable: "Localized Onboarding Flow"
>     - **Q1 2026** → Deliverable: "International Pricing Engine"

## 2. Using Roadmaps to Align Stakeholders

1. **Create a One-Page Roadmap**
    - Show themes on the left, timeline along the top, deliverables in the grid.
    - Use color-coding to indicate status (planned, in progress, done).
2. **Customize Views**
    - **Executive View:** High-level themes and Q-level dates.
    - **Team View:** Detailed deliverables and sprint targets.
    - **Stakeholder View:** Milestones tied to marketing launches, sales events, or compliance deadlines.
3. **Run Regular Roadmap Reviews**
    - Monthly or quarterly syncs with engineering, design, marketing, sales, and execs.
    - Update based on new data, risks, or shifts in strategy.

> Tip: Keep the roadmap flexible—use placeholders ("TBD feature") rather than fixed dates when uncertain.

## 3. Roadmapping Tools

| Tool | Strengths | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Productboard** | Customer feedback centralization & feature scoring | When you need to tie roadmap to user insights |
| **Aha!** | Strategy-to-delivery linking & rich analytics | When you require deep portfolio management |
| **Trello** | Simple Kanban boards & flexible cards | Small teams or lightweight planning |
| **Jira** | Advanced issue tracking & sprint planning | Engineering-heavy teams with Agile rituals |

> Example Workflow:
> 
> 1. **Collect & Score Ideas** in Productboard.
> 2. **Define Roadmap** quarters in Aha!.
> 3. **Break Down Deliverables** into epics & stories in Jira.
> 4. **Track Progress** on a shared Trello board for cross-functional visibility.
