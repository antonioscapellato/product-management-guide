# 10 - Growth Strategies and User Acquisition

## 1. Growth Loops vs. Funnels

| Concept | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Funnel** | Linear path: top-of-funnel → middle → bottom. Focus on conversion rates at each stage. | Marketing → Signup → Activation → Paid conversion |
| **Growth Loop** | Circular, self-reinforcing system: output feeds back into input continuously. | User invites → New users → More invites |

> Example Funnel:
> 
> 
> A SaaS trial funnel might be:
> 
> 1. **Visit Landing Page** (10 000 visits)
> 2. **Start Free Trial** (1 000 trials; 10% conversion)
> 3. **Activate** (500 active users; 50% of trials)
> 4. **Convert to Paid** (100 customers; 20% of actives)

> Example Growth Loop:
> 
> 
> Dropbox's referral loop:
> 
> - **Invite friends** → both get free space → they invite more friends → viral user growth.

## 2. Virality, Engagement & Retention Tactics

- **Virality**
    - **Built-in invites:** Incentivize users to share (referral bonuses, credits).
    - **Social proof:** Show how many friends are using the product.
    - **Co-creation features:** Collaborative docs, shared playlists.
- **Engagement**
    - **Onboarding tours:** Guide new users through core value in first session.
    - **Push & email notifications:** Contextual nudges (abandoned cart, new feature).
    - **Gamification:** Badges, leaderboards, streaks to encourage repeat use.
- **Retention**
    - **Personalization:** Tailor content based on user behavior (recommendations).
    - **Re-engagement campaigns:** Win-back emails, in-app prompts.
    - **Feature anniversaries & milestones:** Celebrate user achievements ("You've sent 100 messages!").

> Example:
> 
> 
> TikTok's "For You" feed uses machine learning–powered recommendations to boost session length (engagement) and Day 7 retention.

## 3. Monetization: Pricing, Upsells & Churn Reduction

### Pricing Strategies

| Model | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Flat-rate** | Single price for full product | Base plan \$49/mo |
| **Tiered** | Multiple packages with increasing features | Basic, Pro, Enterprise |
| **Usage-based** | Pay-per-use (API calls, seats, storage) | \$0.02/API request |
| **Dynamic/Psychological** | Anchoring, decoy pricing to steer choices | \$9 vs. \$12 vs. \$15 (decoy effect) |

### Upsells & Cross-sells

- **Contextual upsell prompts:** "Upgrade to Pro to unlock analytics" when hitting feature limits.
- **Bundling:** Package complementary features at a discount.
- **In-app messages:** Highlight power-user features during natural pauses.

> Example:
> 
> 
> Zoom upsells webinar add-ons and larger meeting capacity once user hits 100 participants.
> 

### Churn Reduction

- **Cancellation surveys:** Capture reason and offer targeted win-back incentives.
- **At-risk user identification:** Monitor usage dips; trigger outreach before cancellation.
- **Customer success check-ins:** Proactive QBRs (quarterly business reviews) for high-value accounts.

> Example:
> 
> 
> A SaaS platform identifies accounts with <5 logins/month and sends a "Need help?" email offering a free training session, reducing churn by 15%.
