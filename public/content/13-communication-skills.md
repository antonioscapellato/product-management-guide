# 13 - Stakeholder Management and Communication Skills

## 1. Stakeholder Management & Influencing Without Authority

### Key Principles

- **Map Your Stakeholders:**
    - **Power/Interest Grid** to categorize (Manage Closely, Keep Informed, Keep Satisfied, Monitor).
- **Build Trust & Credibility:**
    - Deliver on small commitments first (“quick wins”).
    - Share data and customer stories to demonstrate impact.
- **Craft Your Ask:**
    - Align with their goals (“What's in it for them?”).
    - Use "If...then" language ("If we add this feature, then sales can close 20% faster").
- **Leverage Allies & Networks:**
    - Sponsor champions within departments.
    - Co-present with senior advocates to amplify your voice.

> Example:
> 
> 
> To get Legal to fast-track a new API contract, a PM shared user quotes highlighting lost deals, then proposed a 2-week pilot with limited scope to minimize compliance risk.

## 2. Presentation Skills: Story-Telling with Data

### Structure Your Narrative

1. **Context & Hook:** Start with a customer anecdote or startling stat.
2. **Data Backbone:**
    - Use charts or tables sparingly—focus on 1–2 key metrics.
    - Highlight trends ("Our Day-7 retention rose from 35% → 50% after redesign").
3. **Insight & Implication:** Explain what the numbers mean and why they matter.
4. **Call to Action:** Clear next steps or decisions you need.

### Best Practices

- **Visual Clarity:** One message per slide; avoid chart clutter.
- **Annotation & Callouts:** Use arrows or circles to draw attention.
- **Rehearse & Time-Box:** Practice pacing; aim for 60–90 seconds per slide.
- **Engage Your Audience:** Pause for questions, ask rhetorical prompts.

> Example Slide Flow:
> 
> 1. **Hook:** "Last month, 25% of users dropped off at onboarding step 3."
> 2. **Chart:** Simple bar showing drop-off rates by step.
> 3. **Insight:** "Users cite 'too many fields' as the pain point."
> 4. **Action:** "We propose removing 2 non-critical fields."

## 3. Negotiation & Conflict Resolution

### Negotiation Framework (BATNA)

- **Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA):** Know your fallback.
- **Interests Over Positions:** Explore underlying needs ("Why do they need that deadline?").
- **Win-Win Mindset:** Seek solutions that satisfy both sides.

### Negotiation Steps

1. **Prepare:** Define objectives, BATNA, and priority trade-offs.
2. **Open:** Build rapport, state purpose, and set a collaborative tone.
3. **Explore:** Ask open questions to uncover interests.
4. **Propose & Trade:** Offer options; use "If we... could you..." phrasing.
5. **Close & Confirm:** Summarize agreements in writing.

### Conflict Resolution Tactics

- **Active Listening:** Reflect back ("It sounds like...").
- **Empathy & Validation:** Acknowledge emotions ("I can see why that's frustrating").
- **Reframe & Redirect:** Shift from blame to problem-solving ("Let's focus on how we unblock this").
- **Escalation Path:** Define clear escalation criteria and stakeholders.

> Example Scenario:
> 
> 
> Engineering wants more specs; Design feels over-scrutinized.
> 
> - **Action:** Organize a joint sketch session: design walks through mockups, engineer annotates constraints, PM mediates scope trade-offs on the spot.
