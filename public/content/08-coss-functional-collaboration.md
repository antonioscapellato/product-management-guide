# 08 - Cross-Functional Collaboration and Communication

## 1. Working with Cross-Functional Teams

- **Engineering**
    - **Partner Focus:** Technical feasibility, estimates, trade-off discussions
    - **Best Practices:** Involve early in design reviews; respect sprint capacity
    - **Example:** Invite lead engineer to UX critique to surface performance constraints before finalizing wireframes
- **Design**
    - **Partner Focus:** User flows, visual polish, accessibility
    - **Best Practices:** Hold joint whiteboarding sessions; iterate on prototypes together
    - **Example:** Run a 30-minute "design hackathon" with PM + designer to explore 3 layout options for a dashboard
- **Marketing**
    - **Partner Focus:** Positioning, launch messaging, go-to-market assets
    - **Best Practices:** Share requirement docs early; sync on launch timelines and feature hooks
    - **Example:** Provide marketing with feature demo videos and customer quotes 2 sprints before launch
- **Sales**
    - **Partner Focus:** Product demos, pricing, competitive objections
    - **Best Practices:** Co-create sales enablement decks; run "lunch & learn" sessions each quarter
    - **Example:** PM + sales rep role-play a demo and refine the pitch based on real Q&A

## 2. Communication Cadences

| Cadence | Purpose | Attendees | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stand-up** | Quick sync on progress, blockers, priorities | Entire dev squad + PM | Daily (15 min) |
| **Demo** | Showcase completed work to stakeholders; gather feedback | Engineering, Design, PM, Marketing, Sales, Execs | End of Sprint |
| **Retro** | Reflect on what went well, what to improve | Dev squad + PM + Scrum Master | End of Sprint |
| **Roadmap Review** | Align on upcoming themes, risks, dependencies | PM, Eng Leads, Design Lead, Marketing Head, Sales Ops | Monthly/Quarterly |

> Example Stand-up Format:
> 
> 1. What I did yesterday
> 2. What I'm doing today
> 3. Any blockers

## 3. Managing Risks, Dependencies & Blockers

### Identifying Risks & Dependencies

- **Risk Types:** Technical (architecture), market (competitor moves), operational (resourcing)
- **Dependency Sources:** APIs, third-party vendors, regulatory sign-off
- **Tooling:** Use a RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) in shared docs

> Example RAID Entry:
> 
> - **Risk:** Third-party payment gateway may delay certification → **Mitigation:** Start compliance paperwork in Sprint 1
> - **Dependency:** UI library upgrade scheduled by infra team → **Action:** Blocker tag in Jira and weekly check-in

### Tracking & Resolving Blockers

1. **Capture in Daily Cadence:** Call out blockers in stand-ups and retro
2. **Escalate Promptly:** Engage Scrum Master or PM to unblock (e.g., additional resources, design clarification)
3. **Visualize Status:** Kanban "Blocked" column or Jira blocker flag
4. **Follow-through:** Confirm resolution and remove blocker status

> Example Process:
> 
> 1. Developer flags "Blocked" on ticket due to missing API spec
> 2. PM schedules 15-min sync with backend lead same day
> 3. Spec delivered, ticket moves back to "In Progress"
