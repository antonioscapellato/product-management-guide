# 15 - Product Design and Technical Skills

## 1. Product Design: Brainstorm → Prioritize → Roadmap

1. **Brainstorm**
    - Use divergent thinking: mind-maps, "How Might We" questions, Crazy 8s sketching.
    - Involve cross-functional participants for diverse ideas.
2. **Prioritize**
    - Score ideas with RICE or ICE.
    - Align against strategic themes and customer pain gaps.
3. **Roadmap**
    - Group into quarterly buckets under strategic themes.
    - Validate with stakeholders (design, engineering, marketing).

> Example:
> 
> - **Brainstorm:** 20+ features for team collaboration
> - **Prioritize:** Top 5 by RICE (highest scores)
> - **Roadmap:** Q3 "Real-time whiteboard," Q4 "Integrated video chat," Q1 next year "AI meeting summaries"


## 2. Strategy & Estimation

### Market Sizing

- **Top-Down:** Use industry reports (e.g., "Global SaaS market is \$200B; collaboration tools are 5% → \$10B TAM").
- **Bottom-Up:** Estimate users × ARPU (e.g., 50M teams × \$5/mo = \$300M SAM).

### Growth Strategy

- **Acquisition channels:** SEO, paid, partnerships, referrals.
- **Activation hooks:** Onboarding "aha" moments.
- **Retention loops:** Feature anniversaries, in-app prompts.
- **Expansion:** Upsells, cross-sells, account management.

> Example Estimate:
> 
> - **TAM:** \$10B collaboration market
> - **Target Share:** 1% → \$100M ARR
> - **Users Needed:** \$100M / (\$60 ARPU) ≈ 1.66M paid seats


## 3. Technical Fluency

- **APIs:** Know REST vs. GraphQL fundamentals; read API docs, design simple endpoint.
- **Data Schemas:** Understand relational vs. NoSQL, key relationships (1:Many, Many:Many).
- **Architecture Basics:** Client-server, microservices, event queues, caching layers.

> Interview Drill:
> 
> 
> Given an e-commerce checkout API, sketch endpoints for cart, order, and payment, and call out key request/response fields.

## 4. Behavioral Questions: STAR Method

- **Situation:** Brief context.
- **Task:** Your responsibility.
- **Action:** Steps you took (focus on "you").
- **Result:** Quantified outcome.

> Example:
> 
> - **S:** Our analytics dashboard had 20% adoption.
> - **T:** Improve adoption within 8 weeks.
> - **A:** Conducted user interviews, prioritized top-requested widgets, A/B tested two home screen layouts.
> - **R:** Dashboard adoption rose to 55% (+175%) and MAU increased by 12%.


## 5. Live Case Drills & Sample Answers

- **Peer/Mentor Drills:** Rotate roles (interviewer, candidate, observer) and debrief.
- **Top 20 PM Questions:**
    1. Design a feature for [product].
    2. Estimate the size of [market].
    3. Prioritize these 5 features…
    4. Tell me about a time you handled conflict…*(…and more)*
- **Review Sample Answers:** Look for clear structure, data-backed reasoning, trade-off discussion.


## 6. Feedback Loops & Improvement Plans

1. **Record & Reflect:** Video or audio record mock interviews; self-grade on STAR and problem-solving.
2. **Collect Feedback:** From peers/mentors on clarity, structure, depth.
3. **Iterate:** Focus on weakest areas per cycle (e.g., improve market sizing speed, strengthen technical explanations).
4. **Track Progress:** Maintain a simple spreadsheet of drills, scores, and action items.


### Key Takeaways

- **Blend creativity with rigor:** Structured ideation → prioritized roadmap.
- **Be data-driven:** Market sizing and growth models must be grounded in clear assumptions.
- **Speak tech fluently:** API and data schema basics demonstrate credibility.
- **Master STAR:** Practice until your stories flow naturally.
- **Continuous improvement:** Use recorded drills, feedback, and tracked action plans to sharpen skills.
