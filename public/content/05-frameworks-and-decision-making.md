# 05 - Prioritization Frameworks and Decision Making

## 1. Scoring Models: RICE, MoSCoW, Kano & ICE

| Framework | Definition & Formula | When to Use | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RICE** | **Reach** × **Impact** × **Confidence** ÷ **Effort** | When you have hard data on reach & effort estimates | R: 10 000 users/mo × I: 3 (big) × C: 80% ÷ E: 5 team-weeks = 4 800 |
| **MoSCoW** | **Must**, **Should**, **Could**, **Won't** | Quick qualitative sorting; stakeholder alignment | Must: payment flow; Should: gift-card support; Could: dark mode |
| **Kano** | Categorizes features as **Basic**, **Performance**, **Delighters** | Understanding customer delight vs. necessity | Basic: login; Performance: search speed; Delighter: 3D animations |
| **ICE** | **Impact** × **Confidence** × **Ease** | Fast, lightweight scoring with fewer inputs | I: 5 (high) × C: 70% × E: 4 (easy) = 1 400 |

## 2. Opportunity Scoring & Cost–Benefit Analysis

### Opportunity Scoring

1. **List Opportunities:** Based on user pains & needs.
2. **Score Importance:** "How critical is this to customers?" (1–5)
3. **Score Satisfaction:** "How well do competitors solve it?" (1–5)
4. **Opportunity = Importance – Satisfaction**
5. **Prioritize highest gaps.**

> Example Table:
> 

| Opportunity | Importance | Satisfaction | Gap (Opp) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Faster onboarding | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| Advanced reporting | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| Mobile offline access | 3 | 1 | 2 |

### Cost–Benefit Analysis

- **Costs:** Dev effort, infra, training, support.
- **Benefits:** Revenue uplift, cost savings, engagement lift.
- **ROI = (Benefits – Costs) ÷ Costs**
- **Payback Period:** Time to recoup investment.

> Example Summary:
> 
> - Feature "Smart Recommendations"
>     - Costs: \$80K dev + \$10K infra/yr
>     - Benefits: \$150K additional upsell revenue/yr
>     - ROI: (150 – 90) ÷ 90 = 67% in Year 1
>     - Payback: ~8 months

## 3. Building & Maintaining a Prioritization Matrix

1. **Choose Dimensions:** e.g., Value vs. Effort, Opportunity vs. Confidence.
2. **Plot Features/Initiatives:** Map each on the matrix quadrant.
3. **Define Quadrant Actions:**
    - **Quick Wins:** High value, low effort → do now.
    - **Major Projects:** High value, high effort → plan with roadmap.
    - **Fill-Ins:** Low value, low effort → pick opportunistically.
    - **Time Sinks:** Low value, high effort → avoid or defer.
4. **Review Regularly:**
    - Re-score after new data (user feedback, analytics).
    - Update for shifting strategy or resource changes.
5. **Communicate & Align:** Share matrix with stakeholders; adjust based on business priorities.

### Key Takeaways

- **Use the right scoring model** for your data availability and decision speed.
- **Combine quantitative (RICE, ICE) with qualitative (MoSCoW, Kano)** for balanced prioritization.
- **Maintain a living prioritization matrix**—revisit as your strategy and inputs evolve.
