# 01 - Introduction to Product Management 
### (for Tech People Who Like to Build Things That Matter)

Let’s be real—if you're a developer, engineer, or just someone who lives and breathes tech, you've probably had *that* moment. You built something cool. Elegant code, fast APIs, clean architecture. But then you step back and ask: *Did anyone actually want this?* That’s where product management comes in.

This isn’t about abandoning your technical skills—it’s about leveling up. Product thinking is what happens when you zoom out from the "how" and start obsessing over the "why" and the "for whom." It's not just about shipping features; it's about solving the right problems in the smartest way.

## Why This Guide Exists

I wrote this because I’ve been in your shoes. I’ve lived through the chaos of launching features that no one used, and the thrill of building products that users actually love. If you’re technical and curious, you already have most of the tools—you just need a shift in perspective.

## What We’ll Cover Together

* How to develop product intuition without losing your technical edge
* Simple frameworks for making decisions when everything feels like a trade-off
* Talking to users without cringing
* Prioritizing ruthlessly (and sleeping well at night)
* Working with non-technical teammates in a way that builds trust, not tension

## How to Read This

Skip around if you want, or go chapter by chapter. Either way, this is practical, not academic. Think of it like pair programming, but for product thinking. Let's build stuff people care about.
