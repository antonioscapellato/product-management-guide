# 03 - Customer Discovery and Research Methods

## 1. Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research

| Aspect | Qualitative | Quantitative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Goal** | Explore "how" & "why" | Measure "what," "how many," "how often" |
| **Data** | Words, observations, open-ended feedback | Numbers, metrics, closed-ended responses |
| **Methods** | Interviews, ethnography, diary studies | Surveys with scaled questions, analytics |
| **Sample Size** | Small (5–15 participants) | Large (50+ respondents or app users) |
| **Insights** | Deep understanding of motivations & emotions | Statistically significant trends & patterns |

> Example:
> 
> - **Qualitative:** Watching users struggle to find "Add to Cart" in a prototype, then probing "Why did you click here?"
> - **Quantitative:** Analyzing analytics to discover that 60% of users drop off on the payment screen.

## 2. User Interviews, Surveys, and Ethnography

### User Interviews

- **Purpose:** Elicit detailed stories and motivations.
- **Best Practices:**
    1. Use open-ended questions ("Tell me about...").
    2. Avoid leading language.
    3. Record & transcribe with consent.
- **Example Question:** "Walk me through the last time you used [feature]. What did you like or dislike?"

### Surveys

- **Purpose:** Collect structured feedback at scale.
- **Design Tips:**
    1. Mix Likert scales with a few open fields.
    2. Keep under 10 minutes to avoid dropoff.
    3. Pilot test for clarity.
- **Example Item:** "On a scale of 1–5, how easy was it to complete your purchase today?"

### Ethnography (Contextual Inquiry)

- **Purpose:** Observe users in their natural environment.
- **Approach:**
    1. Shadow users in their workplace or home.
    2. Take detailed field notes and photos (with permission).
    3. Ask clarifying questions in situ.
- **Example Insight:** Noticing a user scribbling transaction notes on paper because the app's history view is too slow.

## 3. Defining Personas & User Journeys

### Personas

- **Definition:** Semi-fictional archetypes representing key user segments.
- **Components:**
    - **Name & Photo** (humanize)
    - **Demographics & Role**
    - **Goals & Pain Points**
    - **Behaviors & Motivations**
- **Example Persona:**
    - **Name:** "Budget-Conscious Brenda"
    - **Role:** Freelancer managing irregular income
    - **Goal:** Save for taxes without manual tracking
    - **Pain Point:** Overwhelmed by spreadsheet complexity

### User Journeys

- **Definition:** Step-by-step map of a user's interactions with your product.
- **Elements:**
    1. **Stages:** Awareness → Consideration → Onboarding → Usage → Retention
    2. **User Actions:** What they do/think at each stage
    3. **Touchpoints:** Screens, emails, notifications
    4. **Pain Points & Opportunities:** Where friction occurs

> Example Journey (Onboarding):
> 
> 1. **Sign-Up Page:** Brenda sees social proof, signs up.
> 2. **Welcome Tour:** Brief tutorial highlights "Auto-save" feature.
> 3. **First Save Prompt:** User prompted to link bank account.
> 4. **Confirmation Email:** Reinforces value ("You'll never miss tax deadlines!").
