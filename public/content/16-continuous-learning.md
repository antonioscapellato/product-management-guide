### Quick Wins

- **Data Audit:** Verify analytics instrumentation and share a "health check" report within 30 days.
- **Process Improvement:** Suggest a small tweak to stand-up or retro format that boosts team efficiency.

### Cadence Setting

- **Regular Check-Ins:** Bi-weekly 1:1s with your manager and key peers.
- **Team Rituals:** Confirm daily stand-ups, sprint planning, demo and retro schedules.
- **Stakeholder Syncs:** Monthly roadmap review and quarterly OKR alignment sessions.

> Example 30-60-90 Plan:
> 
> - **Day 30:** Complete stakeholder mapping & deliver analytics health check.
> - **Day 60:** Launch first quick win (e.g., prioritize top 3 UX bugs and deploy fixes).
> - **Day 90:** Present roadmap draft for next two quarters and define OKRs.
