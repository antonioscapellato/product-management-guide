# 11 - Product Metrics and Success Frameworks

## 1. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

**Concept:**

Users "hire" products to get a "job" done—it's the underlying goal they're trying to achieve.

- **Job Statement Template:** When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
so I can [desired outcome].

| Component | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Situation** | Context in which job arises | "When I'm commuting to work..." |
| **Motivation** | What user wants to accomplish | "I want to learn something new..." |
| **Outcome** | Benefit they hope to gain | "...so I can feel productive during downtime." |

> Example JTBD:
> 
> 
> When **I'm stuck in traffic**, I want **an engaging podcast**, so I can **make my commute feel worthwhile**.
>

## 2. HEART Framework for UX Metrics

Developed by Google to measure user experience across five dimensions:

| Metric Category | Definition | Sample Metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Happiness** | User attitudes—satisfaction, ease of use | Survey score, CSAT, NPS |
| **Engagement** | Level of user interaction | Time per session, screens per visit |
| **Adoption** | New user acquisition or feature utilization | % of new users using feature |
| **Retention** | Rate at which users return | Day 7 retention |
| **Task Success** | Efficiency and effectiveness in completing tasks | Task completion rate, error rate |

> Example:
> 
> 
> For a mobile note-taking app:
> 
> - **Adoption:** 40% of new users create ≥1 note within first session
> - **Happiness:** CSAT ≥ 4/5 after in-app tutorial

## 3. North Star Metric & Pirate Metrics (AARRR)

### North Star Metric (NSM)

- **Definition:** The one metric that best captures core product value delivery and drives sustainable growth.
- **Characteristics:**
- Correlates strongly with revenue.
- Reflects long-term engagement.
- Focuses the entire team on a shared goal.

> Example NSM:
> 
> 
> Spotify: **Time spent listening per user per week**
> 
> Airbnb: **Nights booked per month**
> 

### Pirate Metrics (AARRR)

| Stage | Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A**cquisition | How users find you | Sessions, site visits, app installs |
| **A**ctivation | First "aha" moment | % users who complete core onboarding action |
| **R**etention | Continued use | Day 7 retention, DAU/MAU |
| **R**evenue | Monetization | Conversion rate to paid plan, ARPU |
| **R**eferral | Who refers others | % users who invite/refer friends |

> Example AARRR Flow:
> 
> 1. **Acquisition:** 20,000 ad clicks → 2,000 installs
> 2. **Activation:** 60% complete Profile Setup
> 3. **Retention:** Day 7 retention of 45%
> 4. **Revenue:** 10% convert to Premium at \$9.99/mo
> 5. **Referral:** 5% of Premium users send invite code
