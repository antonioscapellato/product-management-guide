# 01 - Introduction to Product Management


## 1. What Is a Product Manager?

**Definition:**

A Product Manager (PM) is the "CEO of the product"—responsible for defining the vision, strategy, and roadmap, and for ensuring that the team delivers value to customers and the business.

- **Role & Scope:**
    - **Vision & Strategy:** Craft the long-term direction.
    - **Roadmap & Prioritization:** Decide what to build, when, and why.
    - **Requirements & Specs:** Write clear user stories and acceptance criteria.
    - **Market & User Research:** Understand needs, pain points, and opportunities.
    - **Metrics & Outcomes:** Set success metrics (e.g., DAU, retention, revenue).
- **Impact:**
    - Aligns cross-functional teams around a shared goal.
    - Bridges business objectives, technology constraints, and customer needs.
    - Drives product-led growth and innovation.

> Example:
> 
> 
> At Spotify, the PM for "Discover Weekly" combined data-science insights with user interviews to define success metrics (skip rate ≤20%, weekly active listeners ≥10M), then coordinated engineering sprints to deliver the first prototype in 3 months.

## 2. Key Stakeholders & Cross-Functional Partnerships

| Stakeholder | Role & Expectations | PM Partnership Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Engineering** | Build, estimate, and deliver features | Clarify requirements; unblock impediments |
| **Design (UX/UI)** | Create user flows, wireframes, visual designs | Align on user needs and aesthetics |
| **Marketing** | Positioning, launch plan, go-to-market campaigns | Sync launch dates; craft messaging |
| **Sales & Customer Success** | Sell the product; onboard and support customers | Relay customer feedback; shape priorities |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Ensure regulatory and policy adherence | Surface constraints early |

> Example:
> 
> 
> Launching a new "Dark Mode" feature requires the PM to:
> 
> 1. **Design:** Validate accessibility contrast.
> 2. **Engineering:** Agree on theming framework.
> 3. **Marketing:** Draft blog posts and in-app banners.
> 4. **Support:** Prepare FAQs for common user questions.

## 3. The Product Lifecycle Overview

1. **Discovery:**
    - Hypothesis generation, market research, user interviews.
    - **Example:** Running user surveys to test demand for an in-app wallet.
2. **Definition:**
    - Write PRDs, user stories; define MVP scope.
    - **Example:** Selecting 3 core wallet actions (add funds, send funds, view history) for MVP.
3. **Development:**
    - Sprint planning, backlog grooming, feature builds.
    - **Example:** Coordinating daily stand-ups; reviewing Figma prototypes.
4. **Launch:**
    - Beta testing, QA, release to production, marketing blitz.
    - **Example:** Rolling out wallet in phases: 10% of users → 50% → 100%.
5. **Growth & Optimization:**
    - Analyze metrics, run A/B tests, iterate based on feedback.
    - **Example:** Testing "fast-checkout" vs. "one-tap checkout" in payment flows.
6. **Sunset:**
    - Evaluate declining usage; plan deprecation.
    - **Example:** Phasing out an underused "social feed" to focus on chat features.
