# 02 - Essential Marketing Concepts for Product Managers


## 1. Market Types

Different go-to-market contexts require different strategies, metrics, and product features.

| Market Type | Description | Key Metrics | Example Product |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **B2C** | Business sells directly to individual consumers | DAU/MAU, CAC, LTV | Instagram |
| **B2B** | Business sells to other businesses | ACV (Average Contract Value), churn rate, NRR | Salesforce CRM |
| **SaaS** | Software-as-a-Service—cloud-hosted, subscription-based delivery | MRR/ARR, churn, expansion revenue | Zoom |
| **Marketplace** | Platform connects supply and demand | GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume), take rate, liquidity | Airbnb |

> Example:
> 
> 
> Airbnb (Marketplace) measures liquidity by "time to first booking" for hosts, whereas Slack (SaaS) focuses on MRR growth and seat expansion.

How you capture value from customers.

- **Subscription:** Recurring fees (monthly/annual).
    - *Example:* Netflix charges \$9.99/mo per user.
- **Freemium:** Basic free tier + paid premium features.
    - *Example:* Dropbox offers 2 GB free; charges for extra storage.

    - *Example:* AWS bills compute time by the second.

> Example:
