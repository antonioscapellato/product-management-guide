# 04 - Product Vision and Strategy Development

## 1. Crafting a Compelling Vision Statement

A vision statement paints the future you're striving to create—bold, inspiring, and memorable.

- **Components of a Great Vision:**
    1. **Future-focused:** Describes where you want to go (5–10 years ahead).
    2. **Customer-centric:** Centers on the value for users.
    3. **Aspirational & Concise:** Big enough to rally the team, short enough to recall.
    4. **Distinctive:** Sets you apart from competitors.

> Template:
> 
> 
> "To [impact] for [customer] by [unique approach]."
> 

> Example (Tesla):
> 
> 
> "To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy."

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Improve onboarding experience** | Increase completion rate from 60% → 85% | Reduce time-to-first-action from 3min → 1min | Achieve NPS ≥ +40 in onboarding survey |

> 
> **KR2:** Achieve 90% positive post-event survey ratings
> 
> **KR3:** Grow MRR by 30% through event-driven upsells
