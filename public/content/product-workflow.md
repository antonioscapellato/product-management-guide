# 05 - The Product Manager’s Workflow

*From inception to iteration: How big tech companies build great products*

In big tech companies, like **Netflix** or **TikTok**, the workflow of a product manager is refined through years of trial and error, experimentation, and iteration. The process is dynamic, data-driven, and, most importantly, aligned with the company’s broader mission. Whether launching a new feature or reworking an entire user experience, these companies have refined the PM workflow to maximize efficiency, clarity, and speed—without sacrificing quality.



## Key Phases of the Product Manager’s Workflow

A product manager’s workflow spans five core phases, each with its own goals, techniques, and processes:

### 1. Discovery and Research

**Objective:** Understand the problem, market, and user needs.
This phase is all about asking the right questions, diving deep into customer insights, and defining the problem before jumping into solutions.

* **Netflix Example:** Netflix famously uses **user-centric design principles** where data from every touchpoint is used to identify “hidden” user problems, such as friction in content discovery or dissatisfaction with recommendations. PMs in Netflix talk to users, study how they interact with the service, and track how they engage with the content.

* **TikTok Example:** TikTok frequently runs **user feedback loops** using A/B testing, heatmaps, and metrics around interaction (swipes, likes, shares, etc.) to identify where users drop off, what features get the most engagement, and where the friction lies.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **User Research:** Surveys, interviews, diary studies, and behavioral research.
* **Customer Feedback Analysis:** NPS (Net Promoter Score), in-app feedback tools, social listening (Reddit, Twitter).
* **Competitive Analysis:** Benchmarking against competitors’ features, design, and user engagement.

**Best Practice:**

* *Don’t fall in love with your solution in discovery.* Focus on finding the real problem first.

### 2. Planning and Prioritization

**Objective:** Align on objectives and build a structured plan for execution.
Once the problem is well-defined, PMs begin the process of determining which problems to solve first and how to prioritize them. It’s about balancing business goals, technical feasibility, and user impact.

* **Netflix Example:** Netflix uses **OKRs** (Objectives and Key Results) to align teams and drive the direction of product goals. They prioritize based on user experience (e.g., reducing the time it takes for users to find content they want to watch) and technical constraints (e.g., optimizing streaming performance).

* **TikTok Example:** TikTok runs continuous **experiments and rapid iteration cycles**. For instance, when TikTok introduced the "For You" page algorithm update, it was prioritized based on user retention metrics and personalized recommendations. PMs at TikTok constantly ask: *“What is the smallest experiment that can prove whether this will move the needle?”*

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Prioritization Frameworks:** RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease), and **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**.
* **Roadmap Planning:** Gantt charts, Kanban boards, and product roadmaps to track features from ideation to execution.
* **Cross-functional Alignment:** Work with stakeholders (engineering, marketing, sales) to ensure business needs and technical constraints are aligned.

**Best Practice:**

* *Always prioritize the **“big rocks”** first. Don’t get caught in the weeds of small features that don’t drive user or business impact.*

### 3. Development and Execution

**Objective:** Build and deliver features iteratively with fast feedback.
This phase is where the rubber hits the road. It involves executing the plan, managing the development process, and ensuring alignment across cross-functional teams.

* **Netflix Example:** Netflix has adopted **agile methodologies** at scale, emphasizing rapid iterations and constant feedback. They leverage **two-week sprints** and integrate continuous testing into the development cycle. PMs play a key role in ensuring that cross-functional teams (engineering, design, marketing) stay aligned.

* **TikTok Example:** TikTok embraces **data-driven development**—constantly optimizing features and user flows based on A/B test results. Each feature release is closely monitored for user interaction and business impact.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Agile/Scrum Methodology:** Sprint planning, standups, retrospectives, and task boards (Trello, Jira, Linear).
* **Feature Flagging & A/B Testing:** Tools like **LaunchDarkly** and **Optimizely** to launch incremental changes, control who sees new features, and gather feedback in real-time.
* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** Automating testing and deployment pipelines.

**Best Practice:**

* *Don’t wait for perfection. Ship incremental improvements and iterate fast.* With big companies, the emphasis is always on speed and adaptability rather than waiting for a feature to be “perfect.”

### 4. Launch and Monitoring

**Objective:** Deliver the feature to users and track the results.
Launching isn’t just about hitting a “launch” button—it’s about monitoring user feedback and product performance to assess the initial impact.

* **Netflix Example:** Netflix uses **feature flags** to progressively roll out new features. This allows PMs to test features with small groups, monitor user interactions, and quickly roll back if issues arise. PMs track both **user behavior metrics** (like engagement time, click-through rates) and **technical performance** (buffering, load times) after launch.

* **TikTok Example:** TikTok’s launch process is **data-heavy**, tracking every metric in real-time after a feature release. PMs at TikTok often rely on **dashboards and automated alerts** to monitor engagement, content creation, and video completion rates.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Feature Monitoring:** Dashboards (Mixpanel, Amplitude), Heatmaps, and **Real-Time Analytics** to track launch performance.
* **Post-Launch Reviews:** Gathering feedback from users, customer support, and metrics to determine whether the feature meets expectations.

**Best Practice:**

* *Always have a post-launch feedback loop in place.* Gather insights quickly to decide whether you should iterate, tweak, or kill the feature.

### 5. Continuous Improvement

**Objective:** Iterate based on real-world data and user feedback.
Product management doesn’t stop at launch. Continuous improvement means consistently refining the product and using insights to optimize future iterations.

* **Netflix Example:** Netflix frequently performs **post-mortem analysis** after feature launches. They look at how their content recommendation algorithms affect user engagement and retention. PMs take insights from these reports to fine-tune the product roadmap and prioritize new experiments.

* **TikTok Example:** TikTok is in a constant **cycle of experimentation** and iteration. They use **feedback loops** to enhance the app experience in real-time, running multiple A/B tests in parallel and quickly adapting to user behavior changes.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **A/B Testing Tools:** Optimizely, **Google Optimize**, and **VWO**.
* **Customer Feedback Systems:** In-app surveys (SurveyMonkey), support tickets (Zendesk), social media.
* **Retrospectives and Learning Sessions:** To track what worked and what didn’t, using **data reviews** to inform future work.

**Best Practice:**

* *Iteration is your best friend. Always go back to the data and keep improving—big tech moves fast because they never stop tweaking.*



## Workflow Components: What You Need to Keep Track Of

* **User Research:** Start early and iterate continuously to gather qualitative and quantitative insights.
* **Feature Prioritization:** Use frameworks like **RICE**, **ICE**, or **Impact vs. Effort** to make data-driven decisions.
* **Roadmap Planning:** Align your roadmap with **OKRs**, ensure all teams are aligned on goals, and regularly revisit the roadmap.
* **Sprint Management:** Implement **Agile** or **Scrum** methodologies, conduct daily standups, and have sprint reviews to assess progress.
